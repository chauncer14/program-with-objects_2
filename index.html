        <div class="content">
          
          <p> The Web is a collection of HTML <em>&#40;hyper text markup language&#41; </em> documents. It was started in the early 1990s, and now has over 30 billion pages! Anything can exist on the web, including Text, Music, PDFs, Videos and HTML. </p>

          <p> The web can be broken down in to 3 major pieces &#45; A computer with a <b> browser </b><em> &#40;such as Safari, Internet Explorer, or Chrome&#41;</em>, <b>servers</b>, remotely located computers that host the files that make up the web, and the<b> Internet</b>, the go between for the browser and servers. </p>

          <p> The browser makes requests to servers using HTTP protocols via the Internet, the browser then reads HTML, interpreting and displaying the page. </p>

      <h2>Lesson 2: Coding Basics </h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p> Coding is writing in a language that computers can understand. Computers are considered &#34;dumb&#34; because they simply <em> follow directions</em>. So it is very important to give them clear directions with proper formatting <em> &#40;syntax&#41;</em> or the computer will return errors.</p>

          <br>Coding is made up of:
          <!-- List -->
          <ol>
            <li>
              <div class="list_title">Tags
                   <div class="list_info"> Tags are always contained within a set of angled brackets, and usually will occur in a set-  opening and closing. They look like this: &lttag&gtcontent&lt&#47tag&gt. So for example, to create bold text, you could say: &ltb&gtTitle&lt&#47b&gt
                   </div>
                 </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>     
                 <div class="list_title">Elements</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> An Element is the information within a set of tags. Elements can have either inline or block behavior.
                   </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Attribute</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> Attributes are information assigned to an element. 
                   </div>
            </li>
            <br>

                <div class="list_title">Anchors</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> 
                    Anchors are used to create links. An anchor tag looks like this &lt;b&gt;a&lt;&#47;b&gt;
                    To create a link, you could say: &lt;a href = &#34;www....&#34;&gt; text that links &lt;&#47;a&gt;
                   </div>
            </li>

                <div class="list_title">White Space</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> 
                    White Space does not naturally exist in coding, so you must force it with break and paragraph tags.

        <h3>Coding Structure</h3>
         <div class="LessonBody2">
          <p> HTML is considered "tree-like" because elements are nested inside of each other, with nested elements inheriting the traits of the parent element. Nested elements are indented - this is seen in written HTML in the wave shape on the left side of the page. </p>

  <div class="LessonBody">
      <h2 id="lesson2">Lesson 3: Adding Style </h2>
       
          HTML has underlying structure of boxes, CSS allows us to change the CSS look and feel of the boxes in a systematic way. This is important because it allows us to <b> avoid repetition </b> when coding - meaning changes are easier to make and we'll have fewer errors. 
          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p> You style HTML using CSS <em> &#40;cascading style sheets&#41;</em>. It gives programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <b> class </b> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class. </p>

            <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              Unlike machines, which are typically physically designed to do a single task, computers are programmable to perform multiple tasks.   Computers can pretty much do anything as long as we can write the sequence of instructions telling them what to do.  We call these sequences of instructions programs. Everything from web browsers to games and mobile apps are simply a precise sequence of steps, that a person wrote using one of the various programming languages for the computer to follow and execute.

              <p>
              <h3>Grammar</h3>  
              Like all languages, computer languages have grammar, rules specifying what is “correct” and “incorrect” - too. As mentioned in an earlier chapter computers are pretty stupid, so we have to write programs using correct grammar for them to understand what we are telling them to do.
              </p>
              <p>               
              <h3> Python </h3>
               Python is one of the programming languages, and is read by a computer using a Python Intrepreter. We call python instructions expressions

            <h2>Lesson 5: Variables and Strings</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
             <p> Variables let programmers assign names to values, which we can then refer to our programs. This helps programs make more sense for humans, as we can assign names that help us understand what is happening within a program. Variables can change within a program when assigned a new value.
              </p>
              <p> We give variables values with the following grammar:
              <br> name_of_variable = value_to_assign, for example x = 2. </p>
              <p> Strings are a sequence of characters. Strings are denoted by single or double quotes. Python reads whatever is in the quotes as a single input. Characters in strings are numbered (starting with 0), and can be referenced in an expression to be manipulated.</p>
              <p>In Python, 2 is a number while "2" is a string. The code 2 + 2 would give 4. The code "2" + "2" would give "2””2” </p>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="LessonBody2">
            <h2>Lesson 6: Input, functions, and Outputs</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <p>Functions take in <b>inputs </b>&#40;data that we want to alter in some way&#41;, perform an action on that data, creating an <b>output.</b> Functions help programmers avoid repetition because we can define it once and refer to it many times. The return keyword tells Python exactly what the function should produce as output. </p>
             <p> Functions take in inputs &#40;data that we want to alter in some way&#41;, perform an action on that data, creating an output. Functions help programmers avoid repetition because we can define it once and refer to it many times. The return keyword tells Python exactly what the function should produce as output. Functions are defined with the following syntax:,</p>
              <p> Def name_of_function&#40;function parameters&#41;: <br>
	              Action to be performed
                Return output <br>
              For example:<br>
          Def full_name&#40;first string, second string&#41;: <br>
	          name = first string + “ “ + second string<br>
	          return name </p>
          <p> Function parameters will be replaced by actual values when the function is called. <br>

              To call the function: <br>
              Print full_name&#40;Chauncey, Robinson&#41; <br>
            >>>> Chauncey Robinson </p>

            <h2>Lesson 7: Control Flow & Loops: if or else and while</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
            Control flows help us execute different code based on certain conditions. <b>If and else</b> are keywords that let us tell what we want to run in different situations. While loop lets us repeat a block of code many times until a certain condition is met. Code under loops is always indented.
            </div>

            <h2>Lesson 8: Debugging</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <b>Debugging</b> in an important step of writing code. The last line of Python error messages are the best place to start, as it will tell you what line the problem occurs on.

            <h2>Lesson 9: Structured Data: Lists & For Loops</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
            Lists are one way that we structure data. Lists are helpful because we can then run through all the elements of a list using a for loop.

            <h2>Lesson 10: How to Solve Problems</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
            Problems can be very complicated, but become much more manageable once broken down in to single functions. The first step in solving large problems is to understand the problem. Next, figure out what are the inputs, and what are the outputs.

            <h2>Lesson 11: Programming with Objects (Object Oriented Programming)</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <p>
            Traditional programming focuses on procedural logic - inputting data, doing something to it, and returning an output. While functions like theses are very powerful, they are not always the right solution, especially for very complex software.</p>
              
              <p>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) focuses on <b>objects</b> (data and procedures) that interact with each other and how we manipulate them, and less on the logic required to do so. Objects are the things you think about first, and are made in to a generic class of object.</p>
              
              <p>The Object Oriented Programming concept <b>classes</b> allows us to make multiple <b>instances</b>, or examples of classes.  To clarify the difference between a class and an instance, a class could be "car" while instance would be "jeep" or "camry". Instances of a class are created using the same code, minimizing repetition and making it possible to define subclasses of data objects. Classes can also be referred to from multiple programs and networks. They also allow us to create new data types that are not already defined in a language. This is a more scalable form of programming and easier to maintain.</p>
              
              <p>
               Abstraction is another central principal of OOP. All but the relevant data of an object is hidden to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. 
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="LessonBody2">
            <h2>Lesson 12: Classes</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <p> A <b>class</b> is package of code, which functions a blueprint or template that can include both data and methods, from which we can make multiple objects, or <b>instances</b>. The <b>init</b> function defined inside of a class, is used to create a new instance. It initializes or creates space in memory for new instance.
              </p>
              <p>Classes are created, structured and used in the following way: <br>
              <nl>
                <ol>1.	Start with blank python file – this will be where the class is defined. </ol><ol> 2.	Within the class file it should look like this: <br><br>
		                  <b>class</b> name_of_class():<br>
                <pre> <b>def</b> _init_ (self, instance_variable1, instance_variable2, etc.): </pre>
                <pre>name_of_class.variable1 = instance_variable1 </pre>
                   <pre>name_of_class.variable2 = instance_variable2 </p></pre>

                <p>When creating an instance, a <b>constructor </b> is called, for example the init function. <b>Instance variables </b> are all variables associated with an instance, and are unique to an instance. They can be accessed using <b>instance_name.variable_name </b> function. <b>Instance methods </b> are functions related to a class. self  refers to the new instance being created, using self is best practice. </ol></p>

              <ol> 3.	To make a new instance: create a new file, in the same folder as class file. Call the class using the <b> from </b> and <b>import</b> keywords. From – lets you import specific attributes from a <b>module</b> (separate units of software) into the current namespace. 
                <p>The from import function has the following syntax: <br>from modname import name1, name2… </p></ol>
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
            <div class="LessonBody">
            <h2>Lesson 13: Inheritance</h2>
            <div class="concept-description">
              <p> <b>Inheritance</b>, a concept introduced earlier in HTML and nested objects, also applies to classes. We can use inheritance to make our programs more intuitive, as objects that are a child inherit the traits of a parent. </p>
              <p>However, due to a concept called <b>method overriding </b>, any functions defined within a child, will always trump any functions defined within the parent class. </p>
              
              <p>This is an example of how you use parent and child classes: <br>
              <pre><b>class</b> child(Parent):<br></pre>
              <pre><b>def</b> _init_(self, trait 1, trait 2, trait 2):<br></pre>
              <pre>parent._init_(self, trait 1, trait 2) </p></pre>
